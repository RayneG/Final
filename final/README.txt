	This is my final project for CompE 561. 

	The idea of this project was to create a website that contained a database of books you could check out. 
Unfortunately, I was only able to get the basics of the website working. I used the tutorial linked by Professor Amack to 
get me started on the project as well as some youtube videos. Much of the code I used was taken from these tutorials 
and not completely my own. 

	I had a lot of issues during the start of this project. The first, being that the tutorial from Microsoft
does not go well in depth enough for beginners, and there was a lot of things missing. For example, I had to download 
several packages that the author of the tutorial assumed the reader would have had. This took up a lot of time to google
an error message and go through the process of downloading it the package. 

	Next, I had an issue with adding a migration in Visual Studio. I would get the Null Object reference error, and 
although I searched for any errors in the code, I couldnt fix it quickly. My solution, was to restart the project several 
times. Lastly, Visual Studio again gave me an error, where I could not create any ".cs" files in my project. It would only list 
TypeScript files, and from google, someone else mentioned a similar problem, where they fixed it be reinstalling Visual
Studio.

	Other than these major issues, most of my time was spent actually trying to learn how to actually create a website/
database in Visual Studio. My website is very bare bones, but it is able to add books and display their information. If I
knew more about this, I would have liked to implement a login feature, so that a user could checkout a book online, and they 
could pick it up physically later on, or they could check out an e-book.
